self randomizing rom!

1. each new game should have a seed value dependent on game clock or sth?
  a. look up how Linear Congruential Generators work! also refer to RNG.C (use the clock as the seed - we need 4 bytes of saved data, .... somewhere)
  b. seed value + fixed value for each table? + base value + something idk
      c. store it in the "last killed by? bytes?" look into 80a4684 NO
  c.ACTUALLY store at 3005264 (last 4 bytes of permanent eventids!)
2. when units are first loaded, they get assigned a random class not dependent on seed
  a. if player unit (read from list) they get assigned a random character (that doesn't already exist)?
  b. growths for each player are modified - look into teq's metis tome hack? according to the seed (should be 1.5rn - avg 1 and 2rn values)
  c. bases for each player are modified by +-30%
3. when class assigned - they get autoleveled weapon ranks and inventory decided by the thing
4. Item stats - weapon mt, hit, wt, etc are modified by +-50% dependent on seed? range maybe one of 1/2/1-2/1-3/2-3/3=10???
5. Skill randomization - this needs to depend on the seed as well. Class skills maybe not randomized but personal skills and learnable skills do - maybe don't change the levels though!


X. how do randomizers determine which mug to show for whom? i don't know but this is less important tbh

global clock stored at 0300:0014
    new game sets clock at 080a4ea4 - hook via bl?
    
palettes: break at load of 895e0a4
loops through 7 classes - if not - do something!
probably will want asm not C for this

8057436
SHORT $2800 $d001 (use the first palette that fits)

same at 8057474
SHORT $2800 $d001

Replace seed with tactician name select???

801096c BL to our own thing once loaded
  clear data at 203f100-203ff00?
  bl to hideallunits

Class cap? - how to do???
goals:
1. fliers and brigands and pirates able to cross terrain
  
2. limit of 15 enemy classes per map?
