These modules deal with some aspects of randomized enemies - both their class and their inventory.

For the "Class Changer" Module, Rando Classes refers to the unit's declared class ID in chapter unit data, before
randomization takes place.

The Random Item Table Editor allows editing the relative probabilities of items showing up in a randomized unit's inventory.

NOTE: If you expand the Random Item Table Editor, ensure that the final entry has Class ID 0xFF so that the game knows to stop checking.

The default probabilities can be found here: http://www.serenesforest.net/fe8/miscellaneous/random-items/monsters/

For example:
The first entry of the Random Item Table Editor is class 0x52 Revenant.

The First Slot Item Group 1 is 0x15.
The First Slot Probability 1 is 100.
The First Slot Probability Group 1 is 0x1.

This means the first slot has a 100% chance of being an item from group 0x15 (Rotten Claw/Fetid Claw).
Which item from group 0x15 is determined using Probability Group 0x1 (95/5).
So, the item has a 95% chance to be Rotten Claw and 5% chance to be Fetid Claw.

The second slot has Item Group 1 = 0x1F with probability 1 = 10 and probability group 1 = 0x2.
It also has Item Group 2 = 0, probability 2 = 90, probability group 2 = 0.
So, the second slot has a 90% chance of being empty and a 10% chance of having an item from Item Group 0x1F using probability 0x2.
