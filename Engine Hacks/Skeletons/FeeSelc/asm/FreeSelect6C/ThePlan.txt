I'm essentially doing the same as the Regular Target Selection 6C: Take as argument a pointer to somewhere in ROM

Free Select 6C:
	2C | word | Pointer to useful routines in rom
	30 | word | Pointer to cursor TCS

useful routines in rom:
	00 | word | OnInit   | Called when the 6C gets constructed
	04 | word | OnEnd    | Called when the 6C gets destructed
	08 | word | OnAPress | Called when the A button is pressed
	0C | word | OnBPress | Called when the B button is pressed
	10 | word | OnRPress | Called when the R button is pressed
	14 | word | OnChange | Called when the cursor changed positions
	
	Arguments:
		r0 = 6C
		r1 = Cursor x
		r2 = Cursor y
	
	Return values:
		& 0x02 | Ends selection when set
		& 0x04 | Plays beep sound (sound Id 0x6A) when set
		& 0x08 | Plays boop sound (sound Id 0x6B) when set
		& 0x10 | Plays gurr sound (sound Id 0x6C) when set
		& 0x20 | Sets cursor gfx to valid
		& 0x40 | Sets cursor gfx to invalid
